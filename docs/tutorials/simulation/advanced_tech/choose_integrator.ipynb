    "`TorchFSM` provides from `ETDRK0` to `ETDRK2` integrators, where the number indicates the order of the method. With higher-order methods, the stability of the simulation increases (allowing the use of larger time steps), but the computational cost also increases. Note that the `ETDRK0` method only supports **linear systems** and is the **default integrator for linear systems**. However, the default integrator is not `ETDRK2` or `ETDRK1` for nonlinear systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our ETDRK implementation, the highest order method is `ETDRK2`. This is because any ETDRK scheme with the order higher than 2 is not numerically stable. To overcome this limitation, we implement the \"stable ETDRK\" method from [2]. In `TorchFSM`, the **default integrator for nonlinear systems** is the fourth-order stable ETDRK method, i.e., `SETDRKIntegrator.ETDRK4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is no free lunch in numerical methods. The stable ETDRK method is more computationally expensive, especially when initializing the integrators. There is an integer parameter `n_integration_points` for the `SETDRKIntegrator`. Some temporary tensors with roughly the size of `n_integration_points` times the variable size will be created during the **initialization of the integrator**. The default value of `n_integration_points` is 16, which is easily cost out of GPU memory, especially when running large 3D simulations. You can reduce the `n_integration_points` to reduce the memory usage, but this will also reduce the stability of the simulation:"
